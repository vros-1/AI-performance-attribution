**Overview**  
The portfolio’s excess return over the benchmark was driven entirely by allocation decisions across sectors, with no contribution from security selection or interaction effects. This indicates that sector weighting was the primary factor influencing relative performance during the period.

**Top Contributors**  
The most positive impact came from an overweight position in the Financials sector, which contributed approximately 0.19% to the portfolio’s excess return. Consumer Discretionary and Materials sectors also added modest positive contributions of 0.08% and 0.06%, respectively. Small positive effects were observed from Energy, Information Technology, and Utilities sectors.

**Largest Detractors**  
Underweight exposure or overweight positions in Health Care and Industrials sectors detracted from relative performance, with negative allocation effects of approximately -0.19% and -0.17%, respectively. Real Estate also contributed a smaller negative impact of about -0.11%.

**Conclusion**  
Overall, the portfolio’s relative performance was shaped by sector allocation decisions. The overweight in Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors added value, while exposures to Health Care, Industrials, and Real Estate weighed on returns. No security selection effects were observed, highlighting the importance of sector positioning in driving performance this period.
