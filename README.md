# AI-performance-attribution
This project recreates a simplified performance attribution workflow using Python, AI, and BI tools. It simulates how investment teams produce monthly attribution reports, combining:
	•	Synthetic sector & security return data
	•	Attribution calculations
	•	Tableau-friendly outputs
	•	Automated commentary written with the OpenAI API
	•	A monthly report build-out

I created this project to strengthen my skills in investment analytics, Python automation, and AI-driven reporting.

## Tableau Dashboard 

You can explore the interactive dashboard on Tableau Public here:  
(https://public.tableau.com/views/AIAttribution/AttributionCommentary?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard visualizes:
- Sector excess returns  
- Allocation & selection effects  
- Automated AI-generated attribution commentary

**Disclaimer:**  
This project uses fully synthetic data generated for demonstration purposes only.  
Because the dataset is randomly generated, many attribution effects (e.g., excess return, allocation, selection) may appear close to zero.  
The goal is to showcase the analytics workflow and AI integration—not real investment performance.
