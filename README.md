# AI-performance-attribution
This project recreates a simplified performance attribution workflow using Python, AI, and BI tools. It simulates how investment teams produce monthly attribution reports, combining:
	•	Synthetic sector & security return data
	•	Attribution calculations
	•	Tableau-friendly outputs
	•	Automated commentary written with the OpenAI API
	•	A monthly report build-out

I created this project to strengthen my skills in investment analytics, Python automation, and AI-driven reporting.
